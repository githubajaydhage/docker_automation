# 🚀 Docker Image Build, Tag, and Push Automation with NGINX
This repository provides a seamless solution for automating Docker image workflows. It includes a custom NGINX Docker image setup and demonstrates CI/CD pipeline integration using GitHub Actions for building, tagging, and pushing Docker images to Docker Hub.

# 📄 Image Overview
Base Image: ubuntu:latest
Web Server: NGINX
Working Directory: /dockers
Exposed Port: 80
This custom NGINX Docker image is ideal for serving static files or as a base for advanced web server configurations.

# 🐋 Pull the Docker Image
Use the prebuilt image directly from Docker Hub:

docker pull <your-dockerhub-username>/<image-name>:<tag>

# Example:
docker pull ajaydhage/autopush:testing

# 🏗️ Build the Image Locally
Clone this repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Build the Docker image:
docker build -t custom-nginx:latest .

# ▶️ Run the Docker Container
Start a container using the built image:

docker run -d -p 80:80 custom-nginx:latest
Access the NGINX Server:
Open your browser and navigate to:
http://localhost
You should see the default NGINX welcome page.

# ✏️ Customize the Image
To serve your own static files:

Add your files to a directory (e.g., static).
Modify the Dockerfile to copy these files:
COPY ./static /var/www/html
Rebuild the image:
docker build -t custom-nginx:latest .

# 🔄 Automate with CI/CD
Streamline your workflow with GitHub Actions:

Edit the Dockerfile as needed.
Push changes to the repository to trigger the pipeline.
Publish updated Docker images to Docker Hub:
docker tag custom-nginx:latest <your-dockerhub-username>/<image-name>:latest
docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/<image-name>:latest

# 📂 Image Details
